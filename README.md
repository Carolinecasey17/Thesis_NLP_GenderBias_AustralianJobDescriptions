# Investigating Implicit Gender Bias in Job Descriptions Using Word Embeddings – an Australian Context  

Scripts for Cognitive Science Masters Thesis

Despite many advances toward gender equality in the Australian labour market, gender segregation in the composition of the workforce and its outcomes persist. Women remain underrepresented at every stage of the career pipeline. Evidence has shown that job descriptions implicitly express gender preferences, which contributes to selectively attracting candidates.

This thesis aims to ivestigate the presence of implicit gender bias in job descriptions in the Australian job market. It utilises the word embeddings Word2Vec model in a a Relative Norm Distance inspired approach to quantify the presence, extent and direction of bias in textual langauge. The biases in job descriptions are compared to other relevant measures, such as gender ratio per industry and GPG. 

Data collection and analsysis has been performed using R and Python. The following scripts are attached: 
- Scraper for extracting job descriptions from au.indeed.com
- Pre-processing script for cleaning job descriptions 
- Word Embeddings analysis using pretrained Google News Word2Vec
- t-SNE plot script 
- R descriptive, explorative and plotting analysis 

The final dataset and acquired gender bias dictionary are also attached.
